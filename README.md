_Abstract_ : Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing green technologies as it provides clean, safe, and renewable electricity generation. This study provides insights into the available methodologies for sustainable power harnessing using wind resources, scrutinizing the developments in the recent decades and the future potential of global wind power industries. Contrasting and comparing the expected Weibull distribution to the true frequency distribution of the actual wind speed, this research proposes an empirical equation using Polynomial Lasso Regression techniques over field data obtained from Turkey, for the instantaneous active power generated by wind turbines in practical scenarios. A detailed overview of the wind energy calculation and improvements is discussed with the existing wind power production techniques. Finally, an optimal analysis of wind power utilization in top Indian states, and inspection of potential wind power applications is carried out with respect to the Indian subcontinent.
